# Missing-Migrant-Incidents

This repository contains the analysis and visualisations of a dataset aimed at migrant incidents occuring as a result of a migrants journey. The dataset contains various aspects of migrants and their journey. With this, I have examined the routes, causes of death, regionality and temporal aspects that migrants have delt with globally to shed light on patterns on insights that can help to understand the challenges faced, and what can be done about it.
